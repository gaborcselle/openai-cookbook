# TODO: The 'openai.api_base' option isn't read in the client API. You will need to pass it when you instantiate the client, e.g. 'OpenAI(api_base=os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"])'
# openai.api_base = os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"]

# Min API version that supports Whisper

# Enter the deployment_id to use for the Whisper model
