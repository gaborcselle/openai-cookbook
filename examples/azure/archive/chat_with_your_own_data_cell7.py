# TODO: The 'openai.api_base' option isn't read in the client API. You will need to pass it when you instantiate the client, e.g. 'OpenAI(api_base=os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"])'
# openai.api_base = os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"]

# Azure OpenAI on your own data is only supported by the 2023-08-01-preview API version
